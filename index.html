          Tame Impala's second full-length, Lonerism, will once again be
          compared to albums from the late 1960s and early 70s. But the project
          is exciting because, by maximizing the use of the available
          technology, it taps into the progressive and experimental spirit of
          psychedelic rock, and not just the sound.

          If their debut was any indication, Tame Impala's second full-length,
          Lonerism, will once again be compared to albums from the late 1960s
          and early 70s. But if their intent was to make a record that sounds
          like it came from that era, they've failed and ended up with something
          more fascinating. Sure, there's merit to the countless groups and
          scenes that seek out the right tube amps and compressors and
          microphones in order to create flawless period pieces. They're often
          called "revivalists," even though the actual term is wasted on them.
          Are they really breathing new life into this form by keeping it
          cryogenically frozen in ideas nearly a half-century old? Tame Impala
          prove far more exciting because, by maximizing the use of the
          available technology, they tap into the progressive and experimental
          spirit of psychedelic rock, and not just the sound.

          Leader Kevin Parker doesn't sound like an electronic producer, he just
          thinks like one. He sees his songs as blank canvases rather than
          boxed-in verse/chorus structures while emphasizing fluidity, constant
          motion, and textural evolution. You could spend the entirety of opener
          "Be Above It" letting your ears luxuriate in the diversity of tactile
          sensations-- the subliminal whisper of the title becomes a rhythm
          track, a barreling drum break is severely tweaked to sound like an
          oncoming rush of bison, a flanged guitar wobbles like neon Jello, and
          Parker's laconic, slightly echoed vocals pulls the whole thing
          together. Lonerism could go anywhere from that point, which is
          confirmed by the majestic song that follows, "Endors Toi". Follow the
          regal path of the lead synth or tilt your ears towards the righteously
          loud drum rolls that sound like masterfully chopped Bonham/Moon
          samples. I'm reminded of Radiohead's stated goal on "Airbag", which
          was to recreate Endtroducing..... in real time, or what DJ Shadow
          himself has been trying to do ever since in terms of merging the
          rarest vinyl grooves with your stony older brother's record
          collection.
